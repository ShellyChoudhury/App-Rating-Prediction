# App-Rating-Prediction
Objective: 
Developed a Machine Learning model to predict the Google apps which have high ratings
Problem Statement:
Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature wherein, certain apps that are promising, are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways including higher priority in recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). These will also get a boost in search results visibility. This feature will help bring more attention to newer apps that have the potential.
Analysis performed 
Identified  the apps those are promising and boosted visibility. App ratings,  provided by the customers, have been a  great indicator for preddicting the apps with high ratings.
